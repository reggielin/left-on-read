Is that food you made?,"Yes, I did.","And, you did not invite me?",,,I donâ€™t feel like answering that because I am not that close to the person much to actully invite her to have my food. Although she might just joking but I did not want to continue the conversation which might lead to actually invite her to have dinner with me. ,,"The work you have watched on a vdo i showed you will be on a show in the museum on Monday. Are you free that day evening? This festival happens once in two years, and i should be fun.",Yeah I think I'll be off that day. Sounds like fun.,Cool. Are you working right now? Have u started your new job already?,I just want to ask how the person is in general but being left on read here was like my question was too boring or that person just did not want to share their expression of living a daily life with me. This actually reflects how they care about my existance. 
Someone taller just did it a way easier way,,I got a V6 on my second try! My first time doing that!!,,Holy shit I just flashed 3 V5s in a row almost 4. Before I'd only flashed 2 V5s ever,"I was hanging out with people and the person was talking about rock climbing, and I didn't really feel like responding at the time.",im excited,wooo wat have u planned so far,yaaaaa,yA,Not much. This person usually leaves me on read and eventually responds later. I've gotten used to knowing that the person is probably busy and will respond later.

We were talking for like a week online and then had a date for sometime Sunday that never happened... but if they weren't interested anymore I wasn't going to bother them about it?
,i think it'll be hard to do it too far in advance? but your timing will probably work well i think,Yaaa hahhaha I looked at things last month and they were all like 'start Dec:,haha yeahhhh,Mhmm lol,it was the end of the conversation/there wasn't anything else to say (idk if this really counts bc it wasn't like there was an alternative/nothing wrong with being left on read but i guess i never really leave people on read!!!),,add me!!! ,,[image for a game where you add friends],i was like why won't you respond to me!!!! bc she didn't add me for awhile (but then she eventually did so it was ok) (but still why did she never respond to me) (there was so much potential for excitement bc i know she plays the game a lot!!!!)

Miss me?,as a friend maybe,Since when were we friends? Lol. Jkjk,,,"This was my ex- an almost 6 year relationship of mental, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. She texted me this randomly about 8 months after I was finally able to break it off, just as I began seeing someone else. ",,I suppose Friday could also work. What's a good evening for you?,Mmmm tomorrow works or Thursday evening just not super late Thursday night Or Friday,"Tomorrow I have class till 8, thursday I'm free around 8 as well. Friday I have a class visit to a museum in echo park so I'll be over there if that's easier. I know you're around downtown a lot.","It's frustrating because I want to make plans to reconnect with this friend. I'm not taking it personally, but I have a busy schedule and I like to make solid plans in advance. "
