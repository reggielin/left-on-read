Is that food you made?,"Yes, I did.","And, you did not invite me?",,,I don’t feel like answering that because I am not that close to the person much to actully invite her to have my food. Although she might just joking but I did not want to continue the conversation which might lead to actually invite her to have dinner with me. ,,"The work you have watched on a vdo i showed you will be on a show in the museum on Monday. Are you free that day evening? This festival happens once in two years, and i should be fun.",Yeah I think I'll be off that day. Sounds like fun.,Cool. Are you working right now? Have u started your new job already?,,I just want to ask how the person is in general but being left on read here was like my question was too boring or that person just did not want to share their expression of living a daily life with me. This actually reflects how they care about my existance. 
Someone taller just did it a way easier way,,I got a V6 on my second try! My first time doing that!!,,Holy shit I just flashed 3 V5s in a row almost 4. Before I'd only flashed 2 V5s ever,"I was hanging out with people and the person was talking about rock climbing, and I didn't really feel like responding at the time.",im excited,wooo wat have u planned so far,yaaaaa,yA,,Not much. This person usually leaves me on read and eventually responds later. I've gotten used to knowing that the person is probably busy and will respond later.
Heh we shuld plan for this week <3,yeah!! sorry I don't check tinder often hahaha. how's it going?,"Haha that's ok! :) It's going well! Just lounging, I got so fried by the sun lol All weekend I mean",oooo where'd you go??,"*bad at responding also* Well I'm not too burned anymore lol, thank da lawd. How's your Tuesday mornin goin??",I came to my senses and didn't want to go on a date with a white man,hey hey. How's yout weekend going?,"Pretty good, i slept in looool so tbh i just got up :) wbu??",,hope ur day was good!! plan for tomorrow?,,Sad!!! We were talking for like a week online and then had a date for sometime Sunday that never happened... but if they weren't interested anymore I wasn't going to bother them about it?
,i think it'll be hard to do it too far in advance? but your timing will probably work well i think,Yaaa hahhaha I looked at things last month and they were all like 'start Dec:,haha yeahhhh,Mhmm lol,it was the end of the conversation/there wasn't anything else to say (idk if this really counts bc it wasn't like there was an alternative/nothing wrong with being left on read but i guess i never really leave people on read!!!),,add me!!! ,,[image for a game where you add friends],,i was like why won't you respond to me!!!! bc she didn't add me for awhile (but then she eventually did so it was ok) (but still why did she never respond to me) (there was so much potential for excitement bc i know she plays the game a lot!!!!) 
I can count the white people that I'm friends with on one hand and my old roommates take up most of it. It's an eight bedroom so it's basically a really lame frat.,eight bedroom?? the actual fuck sorry im hella bad at replying if you haven't noticed yet.,It's a cook house. Add me on snapchat I'll give you a tour. Debounair. Taoyuan smells like Cambodia,,,met this person at friend's party and i thought he was gay but then my friend said he was into me and honestly i was horrified and he's kind of weird conversationally,,msg me from here pls. idk if phone will receive anything.,,*send dog meme*,,my boyfriend never checks his fb messages even though he's on his phone 24/7 and im hella salty because DOG MEMES??? HELLO??? and he still tries to send me videos over mms instead of messenger so im mad
,sis i left my keys home,what keys,cuz i had to use my usb yo transfer dads file to computer check behind his computer,Im not home lol i packed everything so i woudlnt need to go back sigh How would i get it to u Ask mom Call mom,called mom; didn't know how to respond,I'll be in at 10 today :),oh ok see u then~~,,,,it was fine because saw her couple minutes later
Miss me?,as a friend maybe,Since when were we friends? Lol. Jkjk,,,"This was my ex- an almost 6 year relationship of mental, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. She texted me this randomly about 8 months after I was finally able to break it off, just as I began seeing someone else. ",,,,,,
,,,,,,,I suppose Friday could also work. What's a good evening for you?,Mmmm tomorrow works or Thursday evening just not super late Thursday night Or Friday,"Tomorrow I have class till 8, thursday I'm free around 8 as well. Friday I have a class visit to a museum in echo park so I'll be over there if that's easier. I know you're around downtown a lot.",,"It's frustrating because I want to make plans to reconnect with this friend. I'm not taking it personally, but I have a busy schedule and I like to make solid plans in advance. "
"Jesus, that sounds like a ton. It's awesome that you're doing so well with flute! What classes are you going to be taking, and what are you doing for work? It seems like you'll be insanely busy, but at least you'll have a good mix of things to keep you interested. And hey, house sitting hopefully means free rent, right?
",,"And, you did not invite me?",,,"Literally was so busy with schoolwork that I forgot to reply, and then by the time I remembered, a month had passed and I felt WAY too awkward to reply. Plus me and that person always text really sporadically, like we won't talk for months, then we'll talk for a few days to catch up, then again won't talk for months, yet I know we consider each other good friends.",,Are you free on Monday 1-2:50 to record with orchestration class? Cause I'd have to miss conducting and we're doing a lot in these last couple days so I'd rather not miss,,Yeah? Nah? I'll start asking people if you say no lol,,"Really annoyed! I was asked to participate in a music presentation that I couldn't do because of a class conflict, so I needed to find someone to fill in for me. This person is the first person I would trust to do it well, but they're horrible at replying and I was on a short deadline so I needed a quick reply."
"Well if you buy them now it's $10 and next week is $15 and at door $20
",,"Too bad you got a project cuz I was going to ask if you wanted to hangout Sunday
",,,I didn’t want to hang out with them.,"hey, totally anytime! where do we go from here
","The next step is, are you free any time in the next week to meet?
",,,,I wondered if I had phrased my questions incorrectly.
,,,,,,,Heading out! See you soon,"Yep! Hey, just arrived",Yesterday was fun! I'd be down to do something similar again :) ,,Low key offended to be left on read without response but not crazy mad because I didn't care much about this new dude yet though the date was fun lol
Shit so should I come back,Naw they don't care I think. Just the exact things she put in the slack,I'll just say I got a call from mom or something. But if they ask just say I had to step out lol,[OK hand emoji],Is it almost over or?,I knew I was going to see them soon and just was busy doing something and didn’t feel the need to reply. ,just in case you need more ways to say no. i cried,Ahaha but I want to say yes!!!,I CRIED LIKE ACTUALLY READ THEM,Ahahaha okay I will in a lil,,"I mean at this point i wasn’t expecting a response from the text I sent, and it’s a good friend so it wouldn’t have mattered anyways."
^:( can we b friends again,,"Hey, i hoped that if you had a problem with me you would have addressed it directly rather than ghost out on a friendship like you did. I don't think it's very kind to treat people like that, and I think you would have been hurt if the tables were turned. You've made it clear where we stand & I wish you well",,,She wasn't a friend worth keeping so I felt no need to reply,Lmao Ya dude I'm all about creepy first texts,Well you're kiling it lol,,What's your success rate with that so far,,I was pretty salty because this guy and I were talking for like two days straight on a dating app before this and then like 10 minutes after giving him my number he ghosted
,I will follow-up with the Resident Director and keep you updated! ,"Roommate swap again...the nightmare is real From my past experience, if u don't get the room u want, the RD will let you claim a room. What I am thinking is directly jumping into an empty room cause I know nobody who has a nice double or nice roommates will go to the swap event",,I really want to leave my nightmare room,"This back-and-forth process of trying to help the person swap out of their current room (a triple with two other people who previously lived together last year) into a desired double has been going on since the beginning of the quarter. This person has become impatient and while I continue to push on my end, there is not much I can do outside of facilitating conversation. I have responded with the same messages and have given updates but to be quite honest, it's annoying that there is no resolution in sight. I do not want to respond until I have more to share with this person. ",,,,,,
Hey I'm sorry I have to reschedule tonight.,Ok.,I promise we'll hang out soon!,,,"I was upset that they had cancelled on me for the 4568th time in our friendship. I was demonstrating a contrast in tone by not reciprocating enthusiasm toward future plans, ultimately implying my belief that whatever we rescheduled to would also likely be cancelled. ",,Hey what time are we hanging out tonight?,,,,I was upset. I had a genuine question and there was no answer. I'd rather someone be straight forward with their lack of desire to speak to me. 
"hey, how are you doing?",,Hello!!,,hi what's up!!,they have no chill,,Do you know how to mount a TV?,nah,:(,,not great but i guess i deserved it because i was a bitch and only texted him when i needed something
Sum and difference formulas ??,Ahhh those things are useless. You just have to memorize them *tongue out emoji*,We get the formulas on the test lmao I just struggle w using them *laugh emoji*,Like what type of question would be a struggle? *laugh emoji*,"first of all, I'm terrible at math! second, see point 1","I wasn't particularly engaged in the conversation, and didn't want to spend energy in a dying conversation.",Ahaha I need details,What details. We get drunk and we watch the Toby Maguire Spiderman movies,Ahaha that sounds fun,Honestly I can't think of anything better,,I didn't particularly care for this conversation. It was just a tinder match who I didn't find too terribly attractive anyways.
,"btw, if you guys have any desire to go bouldering, my friend and I have guest passes for a place in SF",I want to!!,,,"Laziness, lack of foresight or an actual plan to take them bouldering.",Will you be back for dinner?,No :( Why,Oh we all cooked and are eating together Just wanted to see if you were coming back,</3 Jkz coolbeans What did you make,,No longer useful.
,Ahhh those things are useless. You just have to memorize them *tongue out emoji*,So sooon! Crazy how fast time flies,I know! college literally flew by,I regret not talking to you more,"It felt like he had something to confess, and I didn't want to experience that discomfort. He was someone I didn't really talk to in high school, and most people intimidated me (social anxiety), so it felt weird to think that someone, especially a guy, noticed me. ",Thanks homie. Are you still in that apartment?,"No, we actually moved further away since ___ and ___ broke up.",Sorry to hear that. Glad all you guys are still together though!,"Thanks!!! Its ok, how's everything going???",,I didn't feel too bothered about it. I wasn't in the mood to carry out a long conversation.
yeah of course just hope you're happy with the way i presented my critiques loljk,,[skull emoji],no i'm not! walking in spring!,ah fsho just wondering. danggggg how exciting,I was on the way to class and didn't have time to respond; I forgot afterwards and didn't find it imperative to respond right away.,Lol I feel it Sigh I registered my last cset for next week too so even more stress Why I do this to myself,finals week??? gurl,See I thought like oh just get all the testing done with in one week cuz I don't wanna do it over break I WAS CLEARLY WRONG IN MY DECISION,its okay LOL itll seem like the right one when youre on break,,"I felt okay, since she's my housemate and we talk every single day.

Love,,I'm sorry i sent you that txt earlier. I got into a car crash on Thursday and the hospital keeps putting me on these crazy medications. I'm really sorry,It's all good,I hope you're doing great. I know your classes must be really difficult now,"I didn't think that having a conversation would help either of us. I think that there were still some feelings that are not resolved on his end, and I wouldn't put it past him to have lied to me about what was going on, so I felt like it would be best to shut down the avenue completely instead of playing games and digging in a past that we should not go back to. It's been far too long since we broke up and I need to be allowed to move on, and he needed something that was going to start that process for him. ",6 yrs ago and I'm stillin love w/ u HAHAHAHA,EW I'M SO EMBARASSED Same girl <3,I've done worse lol I use to be so annoying and gross thanks for being nice to me [upside down smile emoji],GIRL i still am annoying and gross plz help me glo up,,"I felt a little sad that the conversation was over and didn't go on for very long, but we're best friends who haven't lived in the same county, state and at certain points country for over 6 years so we cherish the quick connections that we have with each other and understand that we are so busy and that it is absolutely nothing personal, things just happen."
,I'm outside,last night was fun :),,hello? [name]? hello [name]?,They were boring.,wowie I'll ask,,but also the last message in group chat was heated so I'll wait a lil,Yah idk about [name] bc I think [they] post a lot of drama and idk if u need that in ur life Ohhh shit what was dram,,I'm whatever about it. I just wanted to hear drama
No facetime? :(,,,,,I decided to facetime her instead of texting her. ,Good morning Edward and Fausstene. My name is Rayven Miller. I'm contacting you from the Children's Law Center in regards to Nakia Walker. I'm the current investigator on the case. The attorney is sending me out to see Nakia and how she's doing. Let me know your availability,Wrong number,,,,"Unless I communicate to the person about something urgent or important, I don’t mind if someone reads my text and doesn’t respond right away. In this conversation, i felt like she heard everything she needed to know and it was implied that we were on the same terms."
"I felt the same exact way And I'm actually looking forward to being back in Seattle, I had a lot of fun there and made a lot of friends. ",,I can't sleep . Did you accept that offer,,You didn't??,I met this guy on a bus from work once. He didn't get the message that I didn't want to talk to him further. Also random out of context messages past midnight??,,,,,,
yes yes I have to return my radio so imma do that rly quickly ,yeah go for it,kk done im in the omelette line ,,,"I often leave people read when there's no point of reason in me responding, using this example we made eye contact after she sent that message so I just told her where we sitting. ",of course,also lmk whenever you need to get swiped.,"awwww thanks u are too kind, the struggle is real in the apartments","girl I know, anything I can do to help",,I sometimes feel a bit upset if the person doesn't give me a response or replies hours later. 
Hey guys did you all aready do the extra credit project ??,,You wanna do it together??,,We don't have to work together just share data each other,"We worked on a group project and the person barely contributed, so I decided not to work with them again. ",I still have a lot,Thank you for working so hard to support me and brother mommy <3,,I love you so much :),,TBH mother I am shocked beyond belief 
,we should hang out tonight then,Are you still at ____?,im leaving soon,Okay! I'm tired af tho haha,"i didn't really know this person and we kept trying to make plans to hang out. one night we were gonna meet up, but that last message sounded like ""eh i'd rather not"" to me ",,oh NO hahahahhaa do you think he watched it,HAHAAHAHAA no cluedo U think he saw his feature,omg i hope so hahahahhaa and laughed,,"at first i didn't notice until i realized this person and i hadn't chatted in awhile. they were someone i messaged almost every day with lots of ""hahahahhaa""s"

,,,,,"This person likes to randomly message me out of no where with compliments which I used to reply with texts such as “aww thank you for your kind words!” And then be met with the reply “what about me?” And I would say something like “you’re very sweet too” and the cycle would just repeat. In his defense, he is on the autism spectrum so I will talk to him occasionally. But when I do, the messages will just increase and it’s just not a very comfortable conversation so I now often ignore them or do not even open it up unless I have the time and energy to be conversational.
